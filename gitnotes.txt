Creating Git Folder

* mkdir makes a new directory.

* cd changes the current working directory.

mkdir myproject
cd myproject

Initialize Git

git init 
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/user/myproject/.git/

You just created your first Git Repository!

ls will list the files in the directory.
then we check the Git status and see if it is a part of our repo
Files in your Git repository folder can be in one of 2 states:

Tracked - files that Git knows about and are added to the repository
Untracked - files that are in your working directory, but not added to the repository
 When you first add files to an empty repository, they are all untracked. To get Git to track them, you need to stage them, or add them to the staging environment.
